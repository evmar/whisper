# whisper

Playing around with [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).

This program records audio from my laptop mic using
[miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) and transcribes it using
[whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

## Running

See whisper-sys/README.md for building needed `libwhisper.a` dependency.
